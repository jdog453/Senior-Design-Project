- Time: Time is an important constraint to consider for this project. There is a hard due date at the beginning of April, and it is important to make sure that we do not get behind the curve when completing our project. We already established a timeline, and we must do our best to stick to that timeline or we could dig ourselves a hole that we can’t get out of. We also need to be sure that any roadblocks can be overcome quickly, or that we are able to quickly adjust our roadmap to account for major issues.

  

- Security: One of the major constraints/concerns with our project is Security. With a project of this nature, you have to be sure that your hardware and software are well protected. Otherwise, someone can manually disable the turret, or worse, reprogram it to fire at the wrong people. The camera feed could also potentially be hijacked and either used for eavesdropping or hacked so that the computer sees a different feed. The web app that is used to activate and deactivate the project can also be an avenue for security breaches.

  

- Technical: Although part of our project revolves around software, there is also a physical aspect to this as well. We currently have plans to build some base for the nerf gun turret, as well as a device to rotate the object. This group is composed of computer science students, so our expertise doesn’t lie in the construction of building these things. Fortunately, one group member has some experience in this area, so that will help. Due to this, a challenge of our design will be to efficiently and correctly build these objects. The small amount of experience our team has will likely impact the time it takes to construct these items.
