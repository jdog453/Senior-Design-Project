# Senior Design Professional Biography - Fred Jenks

## Bio
I am a Computer Science major fresh off my 5th co-op term. I spent my first semester at Siemens, which didn't really go as planned. After that, I went to Edaptive Computing, Inc. for my last 4 semesters, as well as some part-time work there while I was in classes last fall. While there, I worked mostly on web apps, generally using C# with Entity Framework, JS, and HTML with a quick pit stop in a project using TypeScript and SQL and some work with CentOS 7 and Docker. Outside of work, I enjoy watching/playing sports(go Browns!), video games, listening to music, and working on computers.
