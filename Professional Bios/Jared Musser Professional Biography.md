## Co-op Work Experience
#### Web Developer, Fortech LLC, Jan. 2019-May 2019, Aug. 2019-Dec. 2019, May 2020-Aug. 2020, Jan. 2021-Aug. 2021

 - Used JavaScript, C#, HTML, CSS, and SQL to write web applications for customers and internal company uses.
 - I learned different JavaScript frameworks for this applications, namely react.js, node.js, and vue.js.
 - Database work included writing stored procedures, maintaining the server it was on, and writing complex SQL queries.
 - Most of my work was on my own and my own projects, however, I did get some help some of the semesters from senior developers when I needed it.
 - During the summer semester of 2020 (May to August of 2020) I got certified in C# by Microsoft. 
 - The double rotation when I was working there for nearly 8 months, I was given a project where the ground work was laid out and I wrote essentially the entire application minus a couple things. I did almost all the bug fixes that happened. Another co-op was tasked to help me with bug fixes and quick enhancements. 
 - During that application I created a custom renderer that took data in as a parameter and created a custom way to put the data in a tree format.
 - I also learned the more complex technical side to vue during this project as well. I used vue previously, but not as in depth and complex as with this application.

## Project Sought

 - Game Development Related
 - Web Development
 - Maybe VR Simulation or something similar

I would like to work on a project that requires critical thinking and is a challenge for my group and I to complete so that I can learn and more and gain experience in this type of development situation with pretty specific constraints and working with others on the project itself. I think any of the ideas above would be a cool idea and can provide these challenges.
