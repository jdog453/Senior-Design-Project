# Professional Biography – Andrew Dygert

## Bio
I am a Computer Science major off 3 separate co-op experiences. My first co-op I had a great experience, was unfortunately only able to stay with them for a semester. My next co-op had a similar experience despite to the first, even though the second company was much larger than the first. The co-op also came to early end due to Covid-19. Also because of Covid, I was unable to find another co-op until the Summer of 2021 with Cintas. This was a completely new experience than the first two in both technologies and culture. It ended a little shorter than I would have liked, so I wasn’t able to finish the last project I was working on. Outside of my jobs and classes I do enjoy sports, listening to music, video games, and occasionally coding solutions to some (usually not so serious) problems I encounter in my life
