# Project Description

Personal security is a major issue during these times. Individuals shouldn’t need to worry about the safety of their personal belongings while he or she isn’t there to ensure their safety. Our team has decided to pursue the research and development of a project that seeks to remedy this issue: an automated nerf gun that fires upon trespassers. No longer will people be worried about the safety of their belongings when this device is in use. While this device is on and in a room, should a trespasser be detected (either by facial recognition via a camera or a tripped motion sensor), the nerf gun will fire at them. The sudden confusion and fear of being shot at by a nerf gun will scare away any unwanted guests.

While most people lock the doors in and out of their house, how many individuals lock additional doors within their house while they’re away? Should an intruder get past the first line of defense, then an individual’s belongings are at risk unless there are additional countermeasures. Individuals could purchase costly security measures, but where’s the fun in that? An automated nerf gun turret would be an inexpensive, secure, and fun option for individuals to consider.

If the nerf gun were to fire at trespassers via facial detection, a machine learning solution will need to be implemented to correctly identify the faces of these individuals. Should a motion sensor instead be used to detect the movement of unwanted individuals, a solution that listens to signals from this device will need to be created. A physical track may be developed to allow the movement/rotation of the nerf gun, and some device to pull the nerf gun’s trigger will also need to be created as well. The solutions to these problems will involve programming as well as the construction of these devices.

Our team proposes to construct this automatic nerf gun turret. This turret will fire upon individuals who trespass into the room it’s set up in. The different means by which the turret could fire (facial recognition or motion detection) will be researched to determine the best solution. Our team is composed of individuals studying computer science, so we’re all familiar and proficient with the topic of programming and software development. The development of the physical aspect of this project, such as a track, will require research to identify unique solutions
